Exploring COVID-19 tests through Bayes

 ## Bayesian Funk
Life in the 2020s started off rather rough, as I'm sure you are all aware. When COVID-19 struck, it seemed the world shut down. Questions abounded, regarding the nature of the illness, how it spreads, how deadly it is, and how to remain safe. In the face of immense uncertainty, various businesses closed, and schools were forced to haphazardly improvise online curricula. Some didn't trust the tests and felt that even if they did receive a negative, they would sooner trust their symptoms than the result. Others were the opposite; they were so distrustful of the tests that given a positive result, they would simply ignore it. These concerns were magnified with the introduction of the rapid tests, which gave results in as little as 15 minutes.

Inspired by this, I've decided to take a look at the "accuracy" of the tests. View a more complete look at my findings here

# Chance of having the virus given conflicting tests for various priors and tests.
